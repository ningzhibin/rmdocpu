# how to render a parameterized rmarkdown 



## This is the orignal link for this tutorial

refer to for more detailed infromation

https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/params-knit.html#knit-with-custom-parameters




## this is how you knit the markdown with defined YAML 

```{r eval= FALSE}
rmarkdown::render("MyDocument.Rmd", params = list(
  year = 2017,
  region = "Asia",
  printcode = FALSE,
  file = "file2.csv"
))

```



```{r}
dim(params$data)


```




## can it be used in shiny or openCPU?

it looks like so, onece a button is pressed,  do the render, and then include the html in the shiny


for sure in opencpu, 

will figure out the way to do this
